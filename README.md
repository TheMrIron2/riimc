# RiiMC

An upgraded version of WiiMC for modern Wiis. This is designed to improve effective performance when decoding video as the last official WiiMC release still struggled, notably with higher resolutions and framerates. RiiMC tries to optimize and take shortcuts to make things easier on the Wii hardware to improve the experience ahead of trying to overhaul features.

We had plans to add some additional features, such as Wii U Gamepad support. Unfortunately, this project has discontinued as we no longer have any interest or motivation to work on it. You may still commit to this repository or otherwise use this code, provided you credit us for it as well as dborth himself.
