# RiiMC

RiiMC is an improved and updated version of WiiMC. Since WiiMC is now a dead project and pull requests will likely never be accepted, I have decided to make this somewhat of a standalone project.

Current improvements:

- Now compiles on latest devkitppc

- 4:3 mode now works correctly on old TVs

- Memory usage reduced

- Resolution tweaks

Future goals/WIP:

- Additional controller support

- Improved speed for HD 720p videos

- Gamepad controls on vWii (with forwarder)

- Updated libraries
